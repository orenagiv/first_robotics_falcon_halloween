## PROTOTYPE VERSION
The initial (quick and dirty) prototype is an Arduino project that uses an Ultrasonic sensor to detect a user getting close to a frame and trigger a spooky video to play on a connected monitor.

The system works in two parts:

1. **Arduino Sketch** (`lib/arduino_detect_distance.cpp`): Uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance. When an object comes within 30cm, it sends "PLAY" via Serial.

2. **Trigger Listener** (`lib/arduino_listener.py`): Listens directly to the Arduino's Serial output. When it detects a "PLAY" command, it triggers a spacebar key press.

The `assets/index.html` file contains a simple HTML page that plays a spooky video when the spacebar is pressed.

### SETUP
#### Install Python Libraries
1. Open the Terminal app on your Mac (you can find it in Applications > Utilities or search for it with Spotlight).
2. Install the libraries by running these two commands, pressing Enter after each one:
```bash
pip3 install pyserial
pip3 install pyautogui
```

#### Find Your Arduino's Port
1. Connect your Arduino Uno to your Mac.
2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. Go to the Tools > Port menu. You'll see something like /dev/cu.usbserial-210. Copy this port name exactly.

#### Update the Arduino Listener Script
1. Update the `ARDUINO_PORT` in `lib/arduino_listener.py` with your Arduino's port name.

#### Arduino <-> Ultrasonic Sensor Wiring
1. Setup the circuit per the docs/ultrasonic_circuit_tutorial.pdf (page 148).

#### Running the System
1. Upload the `arduino_detect_distance.ino` sketch to your Arduino.
2. From the terminal, start the listener:
```bash
python3 lib/arduino_listener.py
```
3. Open `assets/index.html` in a web browser for the video display.

### MISC.
Trigger Spacebar on Mac command line:
```
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to key code 49'
```

## RASPBERRY PI VERSION
### Enable VNC on Raspberry Pi
- Connect to your Raspberry Pi with a physical keyboard, mouse and monitor.
- Adjust the screen resolution to 1280x720 via Raspberry Pi Settings > Displays.
- Open a terminal on the Raspberry Pi.
- Enable VNC on Raspberry Pi:
```
sudo raspi-config
```
Or via terminal:
```
sudo apt install realvnc-vnc-server
sudo systemctl enable vncserver-x11-serviced.service
sudo systemctl start vncserver-x11-serviced.service
```
- Install VNC Viewer on your Mac from: https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/

### Remote SSH Setup
- Connect to your Raspberry Pi with a physical keyboard, mouse and monitor.
- Open a terminal on the Raspberry Pi.
- Check the username on your Raspberry Pi (default is "pi"):
```
whoami
```
- Enable SSH on Raspberry Pi:
```
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```
Or:
```
sudo raspi-config
```
- Find Raspberry Pi IP address:
```
hostname -I
```
Or simply use `raspberrypi.local` if your network supports mDNS.
- On your Mac (or Windows via Git Bash terminal), create SSH keys:
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/raspberry_pi.key
```
- Copy the public key to Raspberry Pi:
```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/raspberry_pi.key.pub pi@raspberrypi.local
```
(You'll be prompted to enter the Raspberry Pi password, default is "raspberry".)
- Test the SSH connection using:
```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/raspberry_pi.key pi@raspberrypi.local
```
- Install the "Remote - SSH" extension in VSCode.
- In VSCode, press `F1`, type `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...`, and enter:
```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/raspberry_pi.key pi@raspberrypi.local
```
- A new VSCode window will open connected to your Raspberry Pi.

### Syncing files to Raspberry Pi
- Use `rsync` to copy files from your Mac to Raspberry Pi:
```
rsync -av --exclude='.*' -e "ssh -i ~/keys/raspberry_pi.key" ./ pi@raspberrypi.local:/path/to/remote/Development/first_robotics_falcon_halloween/
```
- To make the rsync also delete older files - use the `--delete` flag:
```
rsync -av --delete --exclude='.*' -e "ssh -i ~/keys/raspberry_pi.key" ./ pi@raspberrypi.local:/path/to/remote/Development/first_robotics_falcon_halloween/
```

### Optimize Videos Performance on Raspberry Pi
- Make sure your Raspberry Pi was set to resolution of 1280x720.
- Use `ffmpeg` to convert videos to 1280x720 resolution for better performance on the Raspberry Pi:
```bash
ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -vf scale=1280:720 -c:a copy output_video_720p.mp4
```

## Halloween Video Player Service
This directory contains the systemd service configuration and installation scripts for the Halloween Video Player that supports both single-screen (`rpi_single_screen.py`) and dual-screen (`rpi_dual_screen.py`) modes.

### Features
- **Single Screen Mode**: Plays one video on a single display with motion detection
- **Dual Screen Mode**: Plays synchronized left/right videos on two displays with video set rotation
- **Auto-rotation**: Dual screen mode cycles through 3 different video sets automatically
- **Motion Detection**: PIR sensor triggers video playback when motion is detected
- **Systemd Service**: Runs automatically on boot with auto-restart capability

### Files

- `halloween-video.service` - The systemd service configuration file (template)
- `install_service.sh` - Script to install and configure the service for single or dual mode
- `uninstall_service.sh` - Script to remove the service
- `switch_mode.sh` - Script to switch between single and dual modes without reinstalling
- `README.md` - This documentation file

### Installation on Raspberry Pi

1. First, ensure your project is copied to the Raspberry Pi at `/home/volvo/Desktop/Development/first_robotics_falcon_halloween/`

2. SSH into your Raspberry Pi:
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/keys/raspberry_pi.key volvo@raspberrypi.local
   ```

3. Navigate to the services directory:
   ```bash
   cd /home/volvo/Desktop/Development/first_robotics_falcon_halloween/services/
   ```

4. Make the scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install_service.sh switch_mode.sh uninstall_service.sh
   ```

5. Run dos2unix to convert line endings (if needed):
   ```bash
   dos2unix *.sh
   ```

6. Run the installation script and choose your mode:
   ```bash
   ./install_service.sh
   ```
   Or specify the mode directly:
   ```bash
   ./install_service.sh single    # For single screen mode
   ./install_service.sh dual      # For dual screen mode
   ```

### Switching Between Modes

You can switch between single and dual screen modes without reinstalling:

```bash
./switch_mode.sh single    # Switch to single screen mode
./switch_mode.sh dual      # Switch to dual screen mode
```

Or run without arguments to be prompted for your choice:
```bash
./switch_mode.sh
```

### Service Management Commands

Once installed, you can manage the service using these commands:

#### Start the service
```bash
sudo systemctl start halloween-video.service
```

#### Stop the service
```bash
sudo systemctl stop halloween-video.service
```

#### Restart the service
```bash
sudo systemctl restart halloween-video.service
```

#### Check service status
```bash
sudo systemctl status halloween-video.service
```

#### View service logs
```bash
sudo journalctl -u halloween-video.service -f
```

#### Enable service (auto-start on boot)
```bash
sudo systemctl enable halloween-video.service
```

#### Disable service (prevent auto-start on boot)
```bash
sudo systemctl disable halloween-video.service
```

### Uninstallation

To remove the service:

1. Make the uninstall script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x uninstall_service.sh
   ```

2. Run the uninstall script:
   ```bash
   ./uninstall_service.sh
   ```

### Service Configuration

The service is configured with the following key features:

- **Auto-restart**: The service will automatically restart if it crashes
- **Display support**: Configured to work with the Raspberry Pi's display (DISPLAY=:0)
- **GPIO access**: User has access to GPIO pins for the motion sensor
- **Logging**: All output is logged to systemd journal
- **Boot startup**: Service starts automatically when the system boots to graphical mode

### Troubleshooting

#### Check if the service is running
```bash
sudo systemctl status halloween-video.service
```

#### View recent logs
```bash
sudo journalctl -u halloween-video.service --since "10 minutes ago"
```

#### View live logs
```bash
sudo journalctl -u halloween-video.service -f
```

#### Common issues

1. **Display not working**: Ensure you're logged into the desktop environment on the Raspberry Pi
2. **GPIO permissions**: The install script adds the user to the gpio group, but you may need to log out and back in
3. **Video file not found**: Check that the video file exists at the expected path
4. **OpenCV issues**: The install script installs opencv-python, but you may need additional system packages

#### Manual service file location
The service file is installed at: `/etc/systemd/system/halloween-video.service`
